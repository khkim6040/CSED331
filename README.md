# CSED311(Algorithms)

## Objective
Algorithms are procedures or methods that solve problems arising across the full range of computing applications. Algorithmic problems from those areas, however, are rarely mathematically well-formed and they often come with application-specific details, most of which are extraneous.\
The goal of this course is to understand how to formulate problems, and from this, how to design efficient algorithms for the resulting problems.\
The course starts with an introduction to algorithms. Then we study four essential algorithm design techniques: recursions, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and network flow.\
We will also spend a few weeks on computational intractability and approximation algorithm, a technique for dealing with computational intractable problems.
